# Hamoye Data Storytelling Stage A

This is the submission of my assessment project of the Hamoye Data Storytelling Internship Stage A.

This project was an assessment of our understanding of the **Introduction to Python for Machine Learning Course.** The dataset was imported, wrangled and analysized from the FAO website.

This food Balance Sheet compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations contains selection of African countries food country supply between 2014 to 2018.

This food balance sheet shows the food items for human consumption, along with how much was produced, used, imported/exported, and how it benefits the society (per capita supply).

The dataset can be obtained via this link [FoodBalanceSheets_E_Africa_NOFLAG.csv](https://github.com/HamoyeHQ/HDSC-Introduction-to-Python-for-machine-learning/files/7768140/FoodBalanceSheets_E_Africa_NOFLAG.csv)
